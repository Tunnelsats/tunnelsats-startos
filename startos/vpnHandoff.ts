/**
 * Clearnet-VPN handoff between TunnelSats and the Lightning nodes.
 *
 * The node owns the tunnel (`clearnet-vpn` action in lnd/cln/eclair-startos);
 * this package only raises tasks. An empty `config` turns the node's VPN off,
 * so whenever the subscription moves to another node or is switched off, the
 * node we previously handed the tunnel to receives an "off" task. Otherwise
 * that node would keep running the same WireGuard key as the new node, and
 * the two would fight over one tunnel (handshake flapping, inbound delivered
 * to whichever node handshook last).
 *
 * Whether a node is off is read from the node itself: the current input of
 * its clearnet-vpn action (effects.action.getInput), the same value StartOS
 * compares a task against. Anything unreadable counts as on (fail closed).
 * Only a TunnelSats tunnel counts as on: our current key, a key we handed
 * out before (`handedOutKeys`, public keys only), or a tunnelsats.com
 * endpoint. Any other VPN is 'foreign' and left alone, even on a node we
 * track: the operator replaced our tunnel, and turning theirs off would cut
 * a VPN we never configured. Deciding by key rather than by the record keeps
 * both cases right: an older TunnelSats key behind a bare IP is still ours,
 * a replacement VPN never is.
 *
 * Limitation: a tunnel handed out before `handedOutKeys` existed is only
 * recognised by our current key or its endpoint host. TunnelSats configs use
 * tunnelsats.com hostnames, and no released build handed out clearnet-vpn
 * tunnels, so this only affects hand-edited or pre-release installs.
 *
 * StartOS does not reap tasks that are not re-raised, and it hides tasks on
 * packages that are not current dependencies, so every node that still owes
 * an off stays in `pendingOff` (declared as an `exists` dependency by the
 * caller) until it is off or uninstalled.
 *
 * StartOS cannot order tasks across packages either, so the new node's
 * on-task is withheld until every previous node is off or uninstalled. The
 * caller watches those nodes' status, so accepting the off-task on a running
 * node (which restarts it) re-runs the planner and releases the on-task.
 * StartOS offers no change notification for action input, so an off-task
 * accepted on a node that stays stopped changes nothing the status watch
 * sees. For that case a TunnelSats health check polls pending nodes
 * (runHandoffRecheck) and requests a re-run once one of them is off.
 *
 * Without a handoff record (fresh install, upgrade from a build that had
 * none, unreadable file) every installed node other than the target is
 * checked, so a tunnel handed out before the record existed is found too.
