# TunnelSats

## Getting Started

TunnelSats provides dedicated, privacy-focused WireGuard VPN infrastructure specifically designed for Lightning Network nodes (LND and Core Lightning).

### Option 1: Native Storefront (Recommended)

1. In StartOS, open the **TunnelSats Web Dashboard**.
2. Select your target Lightning node (`LND` or `Core Lightning`) and your preferred plan duration (1, 3, 6, or 12 months).
3. The package generates a fresh Curve25519 WireGuard keypair locally in-process on your device (your private key never leaves your server).
4. Pay the Lightning invoice directly using WebLN or scan the BOLT11 QR code with any Lightning wallet.
5. Once settled, TunnelSats automatically provisions your configuration and emits a routing task to your Lightning node.
6. **Activate Routing**:
   - Open your target Lightning node in StartOS (`LND` or `Core Lightning`).
   - Accept the 1-click prompt: **"Route [Node] through the TunnelSats tunnel"**.
   - Your node brings up WireGuard internally (`wg0`), announces its public address, and routes all clearnet peer traffic through the encrypted tunnel with fail-closed privacy.

### Option 2: Bring Your Own Configuration

1. If you already have an active TunnelSats WireGuard configuration, open **Services** &rarr; **TunnelSats** &rarr; **Configure** (or click "Bring Your Own Config" in the Web Dashboard).
2. Select your **Target Lightning Node** (`LND` or `Core Lightning`) and paste your `.conf` file.
3. Toggle **Enable TunnelSats** to **ON** and save.
4. Accept the 1-click routing prompt on your target Lightning node.

## Routing & Full Egress Privacy

- **In-Container Egress Privacy**: The Lightning node owns the WireGuard tunnel directly inside its container (`wg0`). Policy routing (table 51820) encapsulates all clearnet peer traffic (inbound connections, gossip, ping/pong acknowledgments) with fail-closed privacy.
- **Zero Residential IP Leakage**: Your home ISP IP address is never exposed to the clearnet Lightning Network.
- **Tor Hybrid Coexistence**: Onion peer connections continue to route normally over the Tor network across the container bridge, while clearnet peer traffic is routed through TunnelSats.
- **IPv4 Routing**: TunnelSats routes IPv4 traffic. Residential IPv6 traffic is disabled by default to prevent clearnet ISP address leaks.
- **Zero Gateway Overhead**: No manual configuration under _System → Gateways_, no interface firewall toggling, and no port 9735 conflicts.

## Bandwidth & Renewals

- **Monthly Allowance**: Subscriptions include 100 GB of transfer bandwidth per calendar month. Bandwidth counters reset automatically on the 1st of every month.
- **On-Demand Telemetry**: Current bandwidth usage and subscription validity are fetched on-demand when opening the Web Dashboard.
- **Proactive Renewal Alerts**: StartOS generates proactive notification tasks 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before expiration. You can renew at any time via the Web Dashboard.

## Sovereign Config Export

You retain full ownership and sovereignty over your cryptographic keys and WireGuard tunnel:

- Download or copy your active `.conf` anytime via the **Web Dashboard** or the **Export WireGuard Configuration** action.
- WireGuard configurations and subscription metadata are securely preserved in encrypted StartOS system backups.
